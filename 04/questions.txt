0.  GIF: 8-bit: 256,
JPEG, PNG, BMP: 24-bit: 16 millions,
BMP: 32-bit: 4 millions.

1.  GIF.

2.  Lossy is having quality lost when compressed, lossless is having no lost
in quality when compressed.

3.  JPEG.

4.  First, the system modifies the filename’s first character in the file’s
directory entry to signal that the file has been deleted and that the directory
entry can be recycled.
Second, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters to the hard drive’s
list of free clusters. The actual file data is never touched.

5.  Simply overwriting user data with one or two passes of random data is
probably sufficient to render the overwritten information irrecoverable.

6.  A header file which defines different integer size widths.

7.  To make sure that the integer you intend to use is in the specified size.

8.  BYTE: 1 bytes,
DWORD: 4 bytes,
LONG: 4 bytes,
WORD: 2 bytes,

9.  BM or 0x4d42

10. bfSize: The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
biSize: The number of bytes required by the structure.

11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the
upper-left corner.

12. biBitCount

13. Out of memory or not enough permissions.

14. You read 1 time RGBTRIPLE size bytes each.

15. (4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4 = 3

16. Skip over the padding by setting the position indicator for the input file
incremented by the size of padding itself relative to the current position
indicator.

17. The current position indicator of file.

18. Look like Rob Bowden with a cat, I can't tell what color though.
